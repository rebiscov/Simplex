# Simplex algorithm

This is my repo for the [simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm), which I need to implement for an Optimisation and Approximation class as part of my master. Please note that this is only academical work.

## Dependencies

This program is written in python3 and uses [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [tabulate](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate)
